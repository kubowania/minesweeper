# Minesweeper using the Recursion Algorithm
A simplified game of minesweeper using vanilla JavaScript


In this walkthrough, I show you how to build Minesweeper in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

This walkthrough was such a fun one to make as I really enjoyed explaining recursion with the help of a south-park-esque cat.

If you have ever wondered what recursion was, this video is perfect for you! [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxdGAKRndz8)

In addition to this, we will also be practising using inbuilt methods such as:

- addEventListener()
- setAttribute()
- fill()
- setInterval()
- some()
- every()
- forEach()
- includes()
- contains()
- add()
- remove()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- push()
- Array()
- continue

And many more.
